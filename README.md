First project at 42Prague. Implementing custom functions that are direct copies of functions in the libc standard 'C' library or functions that have similiar functionality.
In other words re-inventing the wheel. Main topics: strings, arrays, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, single linked lists, function pointers.
